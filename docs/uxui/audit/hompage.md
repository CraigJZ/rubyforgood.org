# RubyForGood Homepage UI Proposal

## Main Menu

- We can fill the primary button on the top right corner and add an outline to
  the secondary button.
- The buttons without rounded corners would look more elegant here.

## Slider

- Slider picture is not loading in quickly and the transition isn't smooth.
- The buttons without rounded corners would look more elegant here.

## Featured Icons Section

- The featured icons above the headers "WHAT WE DO AND WHO WE SUPPORT",
  "FOSTERING LEARNING AND BUILDING COMMUNITY", and "WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT"
  should be able to stand alone without the background and can be colored teal
  with a larger component size.
- The `p` tag can be reduced to just _3 lines_ max.

## Our Impact Metrics Section

- The headers can be highlighted with a line at the bottom.
- The font weight needs to reviewed perhaps a medium or semibold would work.
- The subtitle _text width_ should be reduced.

## Our Supporters Section

- The headers can be highlighted with a line at the bottom.
- The font weight needs to reviewed perhaps a medium or semibold would work.
- The subtitle _text width_ should be reduced.
- The company logos need to be grayscale and made smaller, perhaps with only the
  logomark.

## Footer

- For the social media icons, we can make that dim and brighten on hover.
