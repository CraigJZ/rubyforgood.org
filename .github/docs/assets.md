# Website Assets

The site rebuild is based off of a Jekyll template [insert link here] which uses
various plugins. Many of them have gone stale or out of favor for other tooling.
Below is a list of the different resources that are currently being used by the
site and what their status is in our site build as well as some alternative
tooling.
