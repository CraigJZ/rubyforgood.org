- title: History
  description:
    - paragraph: "Ruby for Good was founded by <a href='/our-team/sean-marcia'>Sean Marcia</a>, in 2013, to fill the gap created by expensive technology solutions that were not easily accessible by non-profit organizations serving marginalized communities. His vision was to create open source solutions that could be used by all, driven by an inclusive community of technologists, of all skill levels, while creating educational and career opportunities for contributors from vulnerable communities."
    - paragraph: "Since 2013, we have harnessed the contributions of over 1,000 volunteer technologists to build efficient solutions for over 150 non-profit organizations that are serving over 2 million people both nationally and globally. We have also hosted 12 software development conferences, totaling over 1,200 attendees, including 150 scholarship fellows."
