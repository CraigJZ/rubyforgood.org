mission:
  - paragraph:
      "Mutual aid groups are community groups that member-led, member-organized,
      and open to all to participate in. Mutual aid participants work together
      to figure out strategies and resources to meet each others' needs, such as
      food, housing, medical care, and disaster relief.  Typically one member
      requests something and they are matched with a member who wishes to
      contribute that very thing."

  - paragraph:
      "Many people working in mutual aid were overwhelmed by requests early this
      year due to the COVID pandemic. Some of these groups were relying on
      dispatchers to match up people who could help each other. These
      dispatchers were in turn relying on spreadsheets, and the spreadsheets
      grew to be unmanageable. We've created an app to support this work,
      currently used by seven mutual aid groups in cities across the country."
