mission:
  - paragraph:
      "Terrastories is a geostorytelling application built to enable indigenous
      and other local communities to locate and map their own oral storytelling
      traditions about places of significant meaning or value to them. Community
      members can add places and stories through a user-friendly interface, and
      make decisions about designating certain stories as private or restricted.
      It is a dockerized Rails app that uses Mapbox to help users locate content
      geographically on an interactive map. Terrastories is designed to be
      entirely offline-compatible, so that remote communities can access the
      application entirely without needing internet connectivity."
  - paragraph:
      "The Terrastories interface is principally composed of an interactive map
      and a sidebar with media content. Users can explore the map and click on
      activated points to see the stories associated with those points.
      Alternatively, users can interact with the sidebar and click on stories to
      see where in the landscape these narratives took place. Through an
      administrative back end, users can also add, edit, and remove stories, or
      set them as restricted so that they are viewable only with a special
      login. Users can design and customize the content of the interactive map
      entirely, and the interface itself is customizable with a color scheme and
      design reflecting the style of the community."
