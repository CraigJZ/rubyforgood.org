mission:
  - paragraph:
      "The Abalone Analytics project is a data tracking and analytics system
      aimed at storing and measuring data for population trends, mortality
      rates, and breeding programs. Designed as a multi-tenant application,
      Abalone Analytics will initially serve two stakeholders, the Bodega Marine
      Laboratory at UC Davis and the Puget Sound Restoration Fund in Washington
      State."
  - paragraph:
      "The Bodega Marine Laboratory's white abalone captive breeding program is
      working to prevent the extinction of the White Abalone (Haliotis
      sorenseni), an endangered marine snail. White abalone are one of seven
      species found in California and are culturally significant to the native
      people of the area. White abalone were perilously overfished throughout
      the 20th century, resulting in a 99 percent population decrease by the end
      of the 1970s. This group is working to reverse their decline and have
      already seen some great successâ€”they currently have more abalone in the
      lab than exist in the wild!"
  - paragraph:
      "The Puget Sound Restoration Fund works to raise and outplant
      hatchery-reared pinto abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), the only abalone
      species found in the Washington waters. This species has cultural and
      ecological significance, grazing rock surfaces and maintaining the health
      of rocky reef habitat and kelp beds. The Washington Department of Fish &
      Wildlife (WDFW) documented a ~98% decline from 1992 to 2017, leading the
      pinto abalone to be listed as a state endangered species in 2019."

  - paragraph:
      "This application will enable groups to add data either through CSV upload
      or through the web interface. Groups can view reports and visual
      representations of key data. Future plans include giving groups the
      ability to generate custom reports on the fly."
scope_and_impact:
  - paragraph:
      "The Abalone Analytics project will help the Bodega Marine Laboratory and
      the Puget Sound Restoration Fund keep white abalone and pinto abalone from
      going extinct."
