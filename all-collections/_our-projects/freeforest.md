mission:
  - paragraph:
      "Research shows nature play benefits children’s health, supporting
      social-emotional, physical, and cognitive development and wellness. Yet
      time spent outdoors in unstructured play is at an all-time low and many
      children face significant barriers to playing in nature."
  - paragraph:
      "We believe all children deserve to play and explore in nature. We pursue
      equitable access to nature play for all children by mobilizing grassroots
      leaders and partnering with school districts, cities and community
      organizations."

      "Our project will help parents and teachers (or maybe even kids!) find
      Free Forest School service areas wherever they might be. We're going to
      use Mapbox, so if you've ever wanted to learn some GIS work with your
      Rails and/or JavaScript, or played hooky to be in the great outdoors, this
      project is for you!"
