  - paragraph:
      "Despite hurricane Katrina happening about a decade ago, there are still a
      lot of displaced people in temporary residences who need somewhere to call
      home. The amazing people at Habitat for Humanity are trying to fix this
      with their work in New Orleans 9th ward (one of the hardest hit areas by
      Katrina) and with a recent grant they received their work is only going to
      move quicker. The problem is, one of the requirements of the grant is a
      stricter recording and reporting process of their 300 or so daily
      volunteers which is where we come in! Let's help them with the great work
      they are doing by making this process faster so they have more time for
      rebuilding people's lives."

      "Volunteers will use this app to sign in and out of work sites by entering
      a touch-based signature on their smartphone. The technical details will be
      decided by the team as a group, but this JS widget for taking signatures
      is promising (try it on your phone):
