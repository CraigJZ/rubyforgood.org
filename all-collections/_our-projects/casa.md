mission:

      "CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) is a role fulfilled by a trained
      volunteer sworn into a county-level juvenile dependency court system to
      advocate on behalf of a youth in the corresponding county's foster care
      system. CASA is also the namesake role of the national organization, CASA,
      which exists to cultivate and supervise volunteers carrying out this work
      – with county level chapters (operating relatively independently of each
      other) across the country."
