mission:
  - paragraph:
      "Coral Gardeners is an NGO based in Moâ€™orea, French Polynesia, with a
      mission to save coral reefs through coral gardening. Their work involves
      two primary activities related to that mission:"
  - list:
      - li:
          "They educate adults and children about coral reefs, why they are
          important and the threats that the reefs face."
      - li:
          "They use the process of coral gardening to restore reefs by planting
          healthy coral fragments back onto the reef, primarily on the reef near
          Mo'orea, which has been heavily impacted."
built_by_rfg:
  - paragraph:
      "Tracking restoration activities is a manual process involving the use of
      an underwater writing board, which then has to be transferred to a log
      booking system. This process is lengthy and labor intensive, and requires
      staff to perform calculations to determine the current status of their
      coral tables. It is also relatively opaque, making historical information
      and trends very difficult to access and assess."
