mission:
  - paragraph:
      "Voices of Consent is a nonprofit organization whose goal is to support
      survivors after a traumatic experience. Locally based, this nonprofit
      operates in 42 states to help survivors. In the aftermath of a traumatic
      event, Voices of Consent sends a box to a survivor who requests one."
  - paragraph:
      "Survivor Boxes are personalized packages put together to let survivors
      know they are not alone after an event, that include resources to use as
      survivors begin the recovery process (including information about laws in
      their state, free health and counseling services in their area)."
  - paragraph:
      "Voices of Consent gets the word out to survivors by talking at schools
      and churches. The boxes are sent to survivors who request them directly,
      or can be picked up at hospitals or police stations."
