write_up:
  - paragraph:
      "Polly Schandorf, pronouns she, her, hers, serves as the Director of
      Strategic Partnerships, leading the strategic development of partnerships
      with our nonprofit partners. She leads event design and execution and
      lends her expertise to team leads and product managers to foster growth,
      inclusivity, and community. Polly is primarily responsible for determining
      barriers to sustained programmatic participation, retention, and
      partnerships that center around people from historically marginalized and
      oppressed communities."
  - paragraph:
      "Polly was a teacher for over a decade and always had a passion for
      technology. Coding Python was a hobby for a while, so transitioning to
      tech was a natural career progression. She attended a bootcamp, and has
      been working in the Rails industry for the last 5 years. She loves the
      Ruby community and enjoys supporting newcomers to the community, making
      sure there is space for everyone. She has spoken at RailsConf, RubyConf,
      and RubyNation. Polly has a long history of community service and has been
      volunteering for various organizations since the age of 14. For almost a
      decade, she has been involved with her local food pantry and soup kitchen,
      and has even served on the board. She also served as a CASA (Court
      Appointed Special Advocate) for a young person in foster care for 2 years."
  - paragraph:
      "Polly has a strong passion for supporting people in her community,
      especially children. She loves to knit, can never have enough kombucha,
      and enjoys growing her own food."
