      "Along with her fearless lead developers, Zoe helped build CASA Volunteer
      Tracking from the ground up in six months and released the first version

      the country to log their time spent with youth in the foster care system,
      and serves as a management tool for staff supervisors overseeing volunteer
      activity. The application is currently being piloted by CASA: Prince
      Georgeâ€™s County, in Maryland. Zoe has extensive experience in civic tech,
      and currently works as a digital consultant in the nonprofit space. She
      has served large petition platforms such as Change.org, and small,
      innovative startups such as Brigade, now a part of Countable."

      "As a former CASA volunteer, Zoe remains dedicated to improving the lives
      of youth in the foster care system across America. One day, she hopes to
      serve as a foster or adoptive parent herself. In the meantime, she keeps
      herself busy as a foster parent to senior dogs."
