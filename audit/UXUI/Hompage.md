# RubyForGood Homepage UI proposal.

#### #001 Slider picture not loading in quickly. Transition isn't smooth.

#### #002 We can fill the primary button on the top right corner and add outline to the secondary button.

#### #003 The buttons without rounded corners should look more elegant here.

#### #004 The features icons like _`WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT`_, such icons should be able to stand alone without the background and can be colored green with a larger component size. The `P` tag can be reduced to just _3 lines_ max.

#### #005a _`OUR IMPACT METRICS`_ can be highlighted with a line at the bottom same go for _`OUR SUPPORTERS`_, #005b their weight need to reviewed perhaps a medium or semibold would work and the subtitle _text width_ should be reduced.

#### #006 The Supporters Icons need to be on a shade of grey and made smaller perhaps with only the logomark.

#### #007 For the social media icons, we can make that dim and on hover brightens up.
