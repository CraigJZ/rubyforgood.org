          We excel at learning about your biggest pain points and envisioning
          solutions that eliminate the tedious, repetitive tasks that take time
          away from actualizing your mission. We then design solutions that
          automate those tasks, so that your team can focus on other essential
          tasks. Our expertise is primarily with building web applications, that
          require the recording and sharing of information, collaboration,
          web-based databases, and coordination tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are facing challenges with sharing, storing or accessing data
          for your organization, we would like to support you in developing a
          solution. Our expertise includes a vast variety of technology
          solutions and we would love to partner with and create one for you!

            Ruby for Good projects are built at no cost to our non-profit partners and are completely FREE!
          </strong>
          We do this to support organizations that are dedicated to serving marginalized communities and making the world a better place.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the past three years we have been very fortunate to have received
          sponsorships from hosting companies to host projects that we have
          built for our non-profit organizations. However, continued sponsorship is
          not guaranteed and your organization may need to find either sponsored
          hosting or fund the hosting for the project once it is built. We will
          work with you to find the most affordable solution for your project or
          to integrate it with your current hosting.

          We estimate that an average project costs anything from $50,000 -
          85,000 in in-kind donations to build, thereafter, maintaining it costs
          on an average $50,000 - 85,000, each year that it is in production.
          So, your commitment and partnership is crucial to the success of this
          huge investment from our volunteer contributors and hosting partners.
          We require that you commit to at least two meetings with the Ruby for
          Good Project Lead prior to the beginning of the project, who will be
          managing and driving your project, and to meetings as needed, while it
          is being built.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will also require your participation, input, and feedback as the
          project is underway and being built, and your support to test it and
          provide feedback once it has been launched. We will continue to
          provide ongoing technical support and maintenance for as long as you
          use the product.

          After you submit your project request, a Project Lead will reach out
          to set up an initial conversation to determine how we can best assist
          you. Occasionally, it turns out that your best solution is to use
          something already on the market. If that is the case, we will support
          you with our best technical advice on launching and adopting that
          solution.
