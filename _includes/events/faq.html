          Attending Ruby for Good
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Ruby for Good DC event is an annual event based out of the Washington DC metro area where technologists from all over the globe get together for a long weekend to build projects that help our communities. In 2021 the event will take place at the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ky3ars6a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shepherd's Spring retreat space</a> in Sharpsburg, MD. Participants will stay in on-site housing with all lodging and meals provided with coding and socializing taking place in communal areas. Join us Sept 23rd - Sept 26th for the fun of giving back!

          How Does Ruby for Good Work?
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is an event for people of <em>all</em> skill levels so even if you are new, we won't let that prevent you from contributing! Attendees self-select into projects that are meaningful to them and then the fun begins! Most projects have a need for a variety of skills including developers, designers, and product management. While most of our attendees use Ruby, we welcome programmers of other languages, especially if you’re interested in learning some Ruby! <i class="far fa-smile maize-crayola-dark"></i> Past years have benefited from attendees with JavaScript, architecture, and design skills as well.

          Interested in Co-Leading a Team?
        </h3>
        <p>
          During registration we’ll ask if you’d like to lead a team—say yes! We’ll be in touch in August with potential projects. We’ll brief you on expectations and put you in touch with your nonprofit. You'll work with them in advance of the event to take care of project requirements, milestones, and initial set up so you can hit the ground running with your team at Ruby for Good. Setup includes creating a GitHub repo under the Ruby for Good GitHub, filing issues to work off of during the event, and making some technology suggestions. If you want to know what it will be like to lead a team this year, <a href="/events/team-leads">read our team lead guide</a>. For an in-depth look at what it’s like to lead a team, check out Brandon Rice’s blog post, <a href="http://www.blrice.net/blog/2015/08/10/leading-a-team-at-ruby-for-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leading a Team at Ruby for Good</a>.

          Several of our projects could benefit from a weekend's worth of focused gooding and it gives us a chance to share the Ruby for Good experience with more folks.

        <p>
          All experience levels are definitely welcome! We have a wide variety of skill levels—some people have next to no experience in programming, some people have decades. But the same applies to other areas too! We have a wide variety of skill levels in pair programming, teaching, or product building—and these don’t necessarily correlate with years of programming experience. The event is as much about learning as it is about building great things. Groups are very collaborative and you’ll definitely have the opportunity to work closely with others and push a lot of code. <i class="far fa-smile maize-crayola-dark"></i>

          Yeah, you really do. Teams will be chosen right around that time and you’ll spend the remainder of the time meeting with your team, chatting about your projects, and getting your environments aligned. We’ve found the event is most successful, with the most buy-in, when teams are a cohesive bunch from the beginning.

          Most of the organizing team is planning on arriving at 2pm but feel free to beat us there. There’s some amazing hiking (of different levels of ease and difficulty) just a few minutes from the venue.

          All meals are catered by the retreat space and Ruby for Good will be providing snacks and munchies in the evenings when we're playing games. Since the venue has some firepits there is a pretty good chance that there might even be some s'mores supplies.
