          The Ruby for Good DC conference is an annual event based out of the DC metro area where engineers, designers, product managers, and other do-gooders from all over the globe get together over a long weekend to work on or build projects that help our communities. Think of it as hanging out in a communal space for a weekend with a bunch of developers and designers to work on something useful. Participants stay on-site; hacking and socializing takes place in communal areas. Join us just for the fun of giving back! Questions?

          This year we are going to be holding the event at <a href="tinyurl.com/ky3ars6a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a gorgeous retreat space</a> in the woods a little more than an hour outside of DC. With the pandemic and the stress of the past year, we wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of the cities where we could de-stress with all of our friends both new and old. Spending time in nature is good for you, and don't take it from usâ€”<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/how-nature-can-solve-life-s-most-challenging-problems-ncna749361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that's just science</a>! Plus, eating s'mores in front of a campfire after a day of civic hacking is pretty much the best thing ever.
